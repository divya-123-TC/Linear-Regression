Task 3: Linear Regression

Objective

Implement and understand Simple and Multiple Linear Regression using the scikit-learn library to predict continuous outcomes and evaluate model performance.


 Tools & Libraries Used

Python
Pandas – for data manipulation
Scikit-learn – for model training and evaluation
Matplotlib – for data visualization and plotting regression lines




 Dataset

Dataset Used: House Price Prediction Dataset


Steps Performed

1. Imported and preprocessed the dataset:

Handled missing values

Encoded categorical data if needed

Scaled/normalized features if required



2. Split the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split().


3. Built a Linear Regression model using sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.


4. Trained the model on the training data and predicted on the test set.


5. Evaluated the model using the following metrics:

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

MSE (Mean Squared Error)

R² (R-squared Score)



6. Visualized the regression line and explored how features impact the target variable.


7. Interpreted model coefficients to understand feature importance.
